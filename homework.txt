----------------------------------------------------

1. Create a class called MathOperations with a method called add(). Implement method overloading for the add() method to allow adding two numbers or a list of numbers.

2. Create a class called MathOperations2. Define a method named calculate that can perform addition of two numbers or multiplication of three numbers based on the arguments passed.

3. Create a class called Shape with a method called area(). Create subclasses called Rectangle and Circle that override the area() method to calculate and return the area of a rectangle and a circle, respectively.

4. Create a class called Vehicle with a method called drive(). Create subclasses called Car and Motorcycle that override the drive() method to print different driving behaviors for a car and a motorcycle.

5. Create a class called Shape with a method called draw(). Create subclasses called Circle, Square, and Triangle that override the draw() method to draw each shape using different graphical representations. [give it a try, it will be discussed in the upcoming class]

6. Create a class called Animal with a method called eat(). Create subclasses called Lion, Elephant, and Giraffe that override the eat() method to print different eating behaviors for each animal.
